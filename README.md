The Attendance Verification Mobile Application is designed to address the issue of employees feeling uncertain about the accuracy of automatic attendance systems. It provides a solution that allows employees to verify their attendance status and view detailed timestamps of their check-ins, ensuring transparency and accountability in the attendance tracking process. By empowering users to confirm their presence with precise date and time records,
the application aims to enhance trust and reliability in attendance management.
**First, we simulated both the automatic attendance recording machine as a web page, and we also simulated the mobile application in the form of a web page that allows displaying attendance details for each worker. 
below are the key points detailling the project progress : 
1. Creation of Database Using XAMPP:
   - Utilizing XAMPP, we managed to set up a MySQL database to store comprehensive information about workers, including their names, functions, IDs, and passwords. This database serves as the foundation for managing worker data efficiently.

2. Development of Web Form for Worker Input:
   - We designed and implemented a user-friendly web form using HTML and CSS, allowing workers to input their attendance-related information conveniently. The form includes fields for their name, function, ID, and password.

3. Implementation of User Authentication and Navigation:
   - Leveraging PHP scripting, we incorporated user authentication functionalities. Upon successful login, workers are presented with two options:
   
     - Option 1: Display Attendance Details: Users can view their attendance history, including the day, date, and time of their presence. This information is presented in a clear and organized manner on a separate page.
     
     - Option 2: Point Presence: Users have the ability to record their presence by the current date and time, facilitating real-time tracking of worker attendance.

4. Technologies Utilized:
   - We have used various technologies, including XAMPP for database management, HTML and CSS for web interface design, PHP for server-side scripting, and MySQL for database operations.
